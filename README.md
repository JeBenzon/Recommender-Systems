# P2 - Recommender Systems

Implementation of a recommender system in a web application.

## Notes
For testing our code, we have chosen **Jest** for unit test and **Supertest** for server testing.
Furthermore, we use **NodeJS** (and *Express*) for our backend.

### Installation
NodeJS can be installed from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will be used to install the modules included in our project

Using `npm install` from inside the main directory for this application, the remaining packages will be installed.

### Testing with Jest
Simply run `npm test` to test.

### Running the server
1. If not done already: `npm install`, npm install socket.io, npm install express
2. node src/server.js
3. Go to your webrowser and enter ://localhost:3000
